title: World Cup Brasil 2014
summary: Finally its here, the world cup!
---
Its fifteen minutes before the kickoff for the Brazil vs Croatia game that will open the Brazilian Worldcup. I can't wait. Not really a football fan anymore (fed up with their pathetic whining and boring matches, ManU losing) but the World Cup is something else. Turning on the coverage on BBC or ITV feeling the atmosphere and feeling my heartrate increase just thinking of the game, the culture of Brazil and their love of the game. Wow, can't wait for it to begin.

So, it was an exciting but not excellent game. Brazil won 3-1 and I fealt that Croatia could have scorred a few so Brazil lucky to get the win.
