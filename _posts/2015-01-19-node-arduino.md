summary: Learning Node and using Arduino

At the turn of the year I made it a goal to become a better JS developer, and having bought an Ardiuno Uno last year and with the Node Programming framework called [Johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) this was a perfect way to connect the hardware with the software, the physical with the imaginary.

Using Arduino in conjunction with Johnny-five is a perfect way of learning Node and also learning more about electronics because I can easily think of something that I'd like it to do e.g. press a button and it posts a tweet to twitter with some information.

Node/Arduino also allows me to get away from the "day job" (concerning the layout and look of things) and it allows me to relax by thinking in a different way.
