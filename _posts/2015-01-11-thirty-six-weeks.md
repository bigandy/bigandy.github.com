Happy New Year! Yesterday we had our 36-week scan at the hospital, just the regular floor of the John Radcliff (not the Silver Star Unit which is on the 6th floor). Older technology and grainier pictures but then baby is too large to get a decent overall picture so no baby photo this time.

Marion had her final week at work before Maternity Leave and yesterday we packed the maternity bag, the baby bag and what is left is the "Dad bag" with food and entertainment to keep me busy/awake during the labour (if it takes a long time) at the hospital.

I am reading "The Happiest Baby on the Block" about ways to calm the baby in the first 3 months (aka the fourth trimester), seems like an excellent book to read and very readable. We have another couple of books about what to expect during the first year to read up on too.
