title: Running again
summary: Last night I ran 5.5 miles, and discovered a new route
---

I've been meaning to re-start running since I stopped in February, and since reading a [running book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B008BTC5E6/), and an [excellent new running magazine](http://www.likethewindmagazine.com/), I found my running kit and desire to go out running<sup>*</sup>.

Last night I went running!

From my house towards Harwell and before crossing the A34 take the bridleway to West Hagbourne (through thick grass, along rutted paths) and then back along a 'B' road to Didcot and then home. 5.5 miles in 47:34.

The route along the road sucked and next time I will find an alternative, probably along the converted disused railway line.

Here's the route I did yesterday:

<sup>*</sup><small>The fact that my colleagues did a 5k Parkrun last Saturday has nothing to do with it (honest!).</small>
