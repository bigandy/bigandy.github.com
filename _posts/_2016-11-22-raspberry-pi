Last night I took out my raspberry pi 3, connected the raspberry pi camera and installed the latest updates, woosh it was very fast. 

I installed [node-raspicam](https://github.com/troyth/node-raspicam) and started taking photos. 

I then installed apache, php, mysql, git and then WordPress. I plan to make something with the [WordPress REST API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API), with [node-wpapi](https://github.com/WP-API/node-wpapi). Something I could do first is to take a photo every hour (or so) with the camera, publish a new post with the photo.

## Future

I would also like to do something with:
- temperature/weather.
- Strava API
- Withings API (I have a withings smart scale)
