title: 10-day Github Streak
summary: 10-day streak on github is nothing but for me it marked a new record.
---
After you've commited code to your github for a few days in a row you will quickly get obsessed by your github streak: the number of days in a row that you have used github, not necessarily code but also pull requests, bug reports and probably more.

My record is now 10 days, and ended last Friday because we went away for a holiday, and it encourages you to code every day.

Of course I code mon-friday for my day job, but this is not counted because we use [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) so the streak is purely out-of-work code.

It encourages you to do something that is not your work, to learn something different or concentrate on side-projects.

Let's see where the next streak will take me!
