I am keen to get back into writing and no time like the present and what a blog is perfect place to write!

In October I started a new job, moving to the radically exciting and fast moving [Venture Harbour](https://www.ventureharbour.com/), as front-end developer. I get to work on a number of different projects where performance is one of the key metrics, as well as continuing to monitor what affects click-through rates, very scientific! In the near future I will be working on a dashboard for keeping track of perf, analytics and other company metrics. 

I have started learning about [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) and will be using those to display the metrics. [Here is a collection of my components on Codepen](https://codepen.io/collection/AKaoMK/). I am continuing to progress with learning Nodejs, currently following [Kyle Simpson's excellent course on frontend masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/realtime-html5-nodejs/).
