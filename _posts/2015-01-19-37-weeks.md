Collecting loose change for the hospital car park, packing the Dad bag, the Baby Shower (surprise, organised by Marion's friend Laura) happened yesterday.

Thinking of what food to put in the freezer for the first weeks when time will be taken over by baby and sleep and nothing else.

Watching our Facebook NCT group to see if any of the others have given birth yet (there are three that are due before us, out of 8 in the group).
