[ifttt](https://ifttt.com/) is an app that does something when something else changes or happens. For example, a recipe (method) I used yesterday is to unmute my phone when I get home. My wife always complains that I never answer my phone but having the ringtone on at work is very annoying, so this is very useful for me.
