title: Open Source Challenge
summary: switching from iTerm and Sublime Text to Open Source alternatives
post_id: x
---

I am in the process of switching from the software that I use. While both Sublime and iTerm are essential in my daily life one will be more difficult to switch away from than the other.

This post is a work in progress!

## [Atom](https://atom.io/)

I have been using Sublime Text for about five years so changing from this to use something else will be a big challenge for me.

I have my own snippets in sublime (e.g. press `cl + tab` and you get `console.log();` with the cursor within the parentheses) and many more things like this that have become muscle memory.

I need to find alternative solutions and then wait for these to become muscle memory as well.

### Gotchas:
- I am using the [beta version of atom](https://atom.io/beta) so if I need to open the current working directory I need to use the `atom-beta .` command.

### Likes:
- inbuilt git support
- inbuilt markdown preview

### Dislikes:
- is not sublime!

## [HyperTerm](https://github.com/zeit/hyperterm)

For me this was an easy transition because there were not many things specific to iTerm that I needed.

### Gotchas:
- I needed to add `EDITOR=atom-beta` to my .bash_profile so I could open the config file
