summary: Looking out of the window at an incredible blue and sunny day

Looking out of the window I can see an excellent early-summer day with blue skies and white fluffy clouds slowly moving across the scene. I soon will be outside, eating my homemade sandwich on a bench and read my current book on the Kindle app on my phone.

I simply love reading books on my Kindle (I have the simplest kindle) and this is something that I could not have imagined 8 months ago. The process of buying new books is remarkably simple, too easy as I have a large number of books on my to-read list, and reading them is simple and distraction free too. No waiting for a book to be delivered, and lots of choice if you don't feel like reading the current book and want to switch to something else.
