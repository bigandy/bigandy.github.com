Ran the Park Loop in 28 mins. Same as last Tues. Found it very difficult today, think I need to do more running as my fitness is not very good. Obviously twice a week is good but this is my only activity every week other than walking to work (via train and bus). I brought some clothes to change into so I can cycle into work. But I need to do more running. More distance, more often.
