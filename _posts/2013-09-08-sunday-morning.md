Sunday morning is most perfect time of the week. I listen to 6Music and starting at 0700-1000 is Mary Anne-Hobbes (although I a never hear all of it, I love her voice and selection of music â€” I first heard her when she was on Radio1 with her Breezeblock show over 15 years ago) and then is Cerys Matthews (again, beautiful - Welsh - voice over even more amazing eclectic music).

In our (new) house we've now got a large sofa and that's where I am sitting, stretching my long legs along the width of the bright red canvas. The sun is shining on my right elbow and back, and the cool autumn air drifts in with a few end of summer slow wasps to keep the cats entertained.

In a while I will make some coffee and then do some DIY with Marion, hopefully decide on which Mattress to buy for our bed, put up the blind in our room, and attach the French house number to the front of our house. Now I am relaxing and enjoying the sunshine and excellent music. I love Sunday mornings for this very reason. Coffee, music and reading.
