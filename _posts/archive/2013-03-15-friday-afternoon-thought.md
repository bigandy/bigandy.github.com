Rain is falling from a dark grey sky marking the end of Winter and the start of Spring. There's a lot

## This weekend
Three key events are on this weekend. It's the final weekend of the Six Nations Rugby and England play Wales to see who will finish the top of the table and (if England win) also if anyone will win the Grand Slam.

The first Spring Classic, Milan San Remo, is on Sunday and I intend to watch it and see who can win. After a long winter with not much sport it's great to be back into the pro cycling season.

This Sunday I am going to run the Reading Half-Marathon with complete lack of training. When I say lack I mean real lack, not run in a month training.
