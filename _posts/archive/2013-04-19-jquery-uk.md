summary: My Review of the jQuery UK Conference
---
I brought my laptop and I am going to use it! So, now I am on the train back from [#jquk](http://events.jquery.com/jquk) in sunny Oxford with an incredible lineup from a wide variety of speakers.

## Brendan Eich

First up was the creator of javaScript Brendan Eich from the mozilla org which was so far above my knowledge level that it still hurts my head thinking about it now. He went over some of the future ECMA script features including modules, classes and stuffs like that. Obs my JS knowledge is not that great currently and it hurt my head.

## Richard D. Worth

Next was MD of jQuery project with an introduction into the future plans of jQuery including today's release of jQuery 2.0 which removes support for oldIE (IE 6/7/8) which has infuriated many developers here at the conference. Personally I support this decision as it allows jQuery to support future and newer browsers without being restricted that supporting oldIE meant.
