summary: Spring is here and the birds are chirping, the lawnmower is mowing, and the windows are open.

Tuesday morning and I'm at work with the windows wide open and I can hear the sounds of the lawnmower outside of the window mixing with the chirps of the early morning (human time) birds. Winter was long and wearisome and seemed that it would never end.

But Spring is here and we can shed our ten layers of clothes and get out there into the warmth and sun!
