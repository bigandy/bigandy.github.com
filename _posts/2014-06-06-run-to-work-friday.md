title: Run to Work Friday
summary: I ran to work this morning because we are going away this weekend and I couldn't leave my bike at work.

Huh, what is this, two runs in one week? Crazy!

With aching thighs and ticking clock I put on my running kit and ran to work, along the straitest horriblest road on Earth. Ok, it is not that bad but it is not much fun either. Cars whizzing past at 60mph churning pollutant gases in my face.

2.7 miles in approx 22mins (Watch needs USB stick to connect to Strava, and that is at home).
