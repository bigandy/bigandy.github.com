title: Running at Lunch!
Summary: First run of the month. 5.55 miles in 44:28
---

This is the first time I’ve been running in March and it’s also the longest lunchtime run that I’ve done. 5.55 miles in 44:28.

I ran from the Science Park along one of the pedestrian paths and out into a muddy water-logged field, 3/4 round the field and then towards Sutton Cortenay, past the roundabout for 1 mile then double back to the roundabout and continue the Milton Park Loop. The final 2.5 miles were very tough, showing my total lack of fitness.

I also spotted the option to do a different route while returning through Sutton Cortenay.
