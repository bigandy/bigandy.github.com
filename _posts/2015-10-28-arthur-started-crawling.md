title: Arthur Started Crawling
summary: Arthur began crawling this morning

Now 8.5 months old and in the middle of teething (he had his first tooth last Friday) but finally it seems as if he wants to crawl. He can crawl a little bit, and so far only to get the books or the tamborine. Exciting times!
