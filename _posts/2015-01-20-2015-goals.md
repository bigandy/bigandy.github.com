title: Goals for 2015
summary: Here are my Goals for 2015
<!-- post_id: x -->
---

Seems as if the trend for late-January is to post goals for 2015 so without further waffle here are mine:

- [Become a better JS developer](#become-a-better-js-developer)
- [write more often](#write-more-often)
- eat a better diet
- exercise more often
- [deconnect in the evenings and weekends](#switch-off-from-connectivity)

## Become a better JS Developer
The way of the web, and offline too with the immanent rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), as well as drones, connected homes and smart devices. Some call this the [ST4i](http://seb.ly/st4i-stuff-that-talks-to-the-interwebs/) (Stuff that talks to the Interwebs). All of this can be controlled and monitored by JavaScript.

I have an Arduino Uno and I plan (have already started) to use the intersection between physical and coding to do "smart" things.

## Switch off from Connectivity
I already switch off from twitter and facebook (and email, to a lesser extent) at the weekend, but in the evening I often check the social feeds, often this leaves me wired and unable to relax and share quality time with my wife.

I'd like to switch off in the evenings as well.

## Write more often
This is the place that I first compose blog posts, before I put them on [my other site](big-andy.co.uk). But I want to write more, to exercise my mental and creative muscles.
