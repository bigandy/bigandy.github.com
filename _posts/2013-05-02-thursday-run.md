Ran a different route, this time out of the Science Park at the A34 roundabout then towards GWP, along the fast road with stinky lorries and speeding cars. Thick pollution. Long straight road. Sun. Hot. Pain, bah!!! Then over the road at the roundabout, over the railway line and back towards the Science Park. [4.8 miles in 38:33](http://app.strava.com/activities/51971906)
