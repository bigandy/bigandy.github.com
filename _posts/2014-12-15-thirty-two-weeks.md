We have been really busy this last month: having the first two NCT classes and meeting expectant Mums and Dads from the local area; choosing Pushchairs, car seats, and searching for new camera to record the baby's first moments; visiting Bath for the Christmas market and now getting ready for Christmas, and a little bit of relaxing by watching the latest Hobbit film with friends last night in Reading.

Time is going crazily fast, there are just ten days until Christmas day and there's still much to do before then. Most of the Christmas presents are bought,but there are parties and meals still to be had.

We still need to decorate the walls of the baby room, order things like nappies and some newborn clothes (although friends have been very generous by giving their cast-me-down baby clothes!) and relax!
