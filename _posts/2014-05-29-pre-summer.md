Inspired by the excellent jQuery UK 2014 talk about "Hardware Hacking with JavaScript" I ordered an arduino starter kit: leds, resistors, motor, servo, capacitors and much more. I am learning the basics, using the johnny-five node.js framework. 

So far I have gone through the basic turning an LED off and on, progressed to multiple LEDs and turning them on/off in sequence or at different frequencies. It is really good fun.
