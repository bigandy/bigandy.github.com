Second run of the week, this time I drove up to the Ridgeway with Marion and Arthur who went a walk while I suffered along for twenty minutes East and then twenty one minutes back.

My legs were heavy and the sun was blazing. It'll be great to be able to run without suffering and pain. That will happen in a few weeks or months. Fitness is a long way away and too much cake and beer has been consumed. Too many miles have been driven in the car rather than on the bike.
