# bigandy.pw

## Setup

If you don't have jekyll on your system you need to install jekyll and jekyll-paginate:
`sudo gem install jeykll`
`sudo gem install jekyll-paginate`
- install npm deps `npm install`
- gulp
- in your browser go to [127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).

This is the code behind [bigandy.pw](https://bigandy.pw) a place where I can write posts, quickly publish demos.
